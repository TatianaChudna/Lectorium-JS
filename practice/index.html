  <div class="block" id="first-block">Schlumbergera is a small genus of cacti with six to nine species found in the
    coastal mountains of south-eastern Brazil. Plants grow on trees or rocks in habitats that are generally shady with
    high humidity, and can be quite different in appearance from their desert-dwelling cousins. Most species of
    Schlumbergera have stems which resemble leaf-like pads joined one to the other and flowers which appear from areoles
    at the joints and tips of the stems. Two species have cylindrical stems more similar to other cacti. Recent
    phylogenetic studies using DNA have led to three species of the related genus Hatiora being transferred into
    Schlumbergera,[1] though this change is not universally accepted.

    The Truncata Group contains all cultivars with features derived mainly from the species S. truncata: stem segments
    with pointed teeth; flowers held more or less horizontally, usually above the horizontal, whose upper side is
    differently shaped from the lower side (zygomorphic); and pollen which is yellow. They generally flower earlier than
    members of the Buckleyi Group and, although common names are not applied consistently, may be distinguished as
    Thanksgiving cactus, crab cactus or claw cactus.

  <div class="block" id="third-block">
    The Buckleyi Group contains all cultivars with at least some features clearly showing inheritance from S.
    russelliana: stem segments with rounded, more symmetrical teeth; more or less symmetrical (regular) flowers which
    hang down, below the horizontal; and pollen which is pink. They generally flower later than members of the Truncata
    Group and are more likely to be called Christmas cactus.
